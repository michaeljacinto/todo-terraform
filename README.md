Provision a tutorial application which uses Node.js, React.js, and MySQL, using Terraform & Microsoft Azure.

#### Provisioning
1. Download and install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
2. Download and install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads). Make sure to include it inside your system's [PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
3. Clone this repository and open a terminal with the current path inside the new folder.
4. Run ```terraform apply``` and enter ```yes``` when prompted. This process should take 10-15 minutes. Once finished, a URL will output where you can access the application.
#### Clean up
1. Run ```terraform destroy``` to delete resources or you can delete the resource group manually on the Azure portal.
